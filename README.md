# test-commits
to test the commits and braching strategy
we will use gitflow of atlassian where develop and release branches are there. But we will only use commit merge and not squash and merge.

this is a commit done to the develop branch. After this commit we will create a release-1 branch from this branch. keep watching this space for more fun. 

These are the changes that are committed to release-1 branch. We plan to commit around 3 to 4 commits to this branch. 

This is the next commit for the release-1 branch. More commits to follow. 

okay, this is the last commit for the release-1 branch. We will next merge this to main and develop branches. NO squash only merge commits. 

release-1 is off. These are new changes that are being done in develop branch. No changes directly added to main branch.

last commit to develop branch before release-2 changes. less gooo

release-2 activities have started. After this one more commit will be done. 

Time to test our understanding. Last commit to release-2 then we try to merge chagnes to develop and main.
