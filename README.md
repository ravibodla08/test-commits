# test-commits
to test the commits and braching strategy
we will use gitflow of atlassian where develop and release branches are there. But we will only use commit merge and not squash and merge.

this is a commit done to the develop branch. After this commit we will create a release-1 branch from this branch. keep watching this space for more fun.
